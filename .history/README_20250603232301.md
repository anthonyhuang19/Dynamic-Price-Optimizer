# Dynamic Pricing Model for Ride-Sharing Services

## Abstract

This project implements a machine learning model for dynamic pricing in ride-sharing services. We develop and evaluate several regression models to predict ride costs based on various factors such as distance, time of day, and weather conditions. Our best-performing model achieves [insert performance metrics here], demonstrating its potential for real-world application in optimizing pricing strategies for ride-sharing platforms.

## Introduction

Dynamic pricing is a crucial component of modern ride-sharing services, balancing supply and demand while maximizing both rider satisfaction and driver earnings. This project aims to create a robust, data-driven model for predicting optimal ride prices in real-time.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

We utilized a dataset containing [insert number] ride records, including features such as [list key features]. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

### Feature Engineering

Several derived features were created, including [list any important engineered features]. Feature importance was analyzed using [mention technique, e.g., correlation analysis, mutual information].

### Model Development

We experimented with multiple regression algorithms, including:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, CatBoost)
- Support Vector Regression
- Neural Networks

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using [mention technique, e.g., grid search, random search] with cross-validation.

## Results

Our best-performing model, a [insert best model type], achieved the following metrics on the test set:
- RMSE: [value]
- R-squared: [value]

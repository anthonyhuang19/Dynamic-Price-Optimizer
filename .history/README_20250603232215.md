## Overview

Dynamic pricing is a powerful strategy for optimizing pricing decisions based on market conditions, consumer behavior, and supply-demand dynamics. This project focuses on building and deploying dynamic pricing models to automate the price optimization process for products in real-time. By utilizing machine learning techniques, we aim to maximize revenue while maintaining competitive pricing strategies.

This repository contains the implementation of the dynamic pricing model, experimental results, and steps for reproducing the experiments.

## Project Description

The dynamic pricing model is designed to optimize product prices in real-time using a combination of historical sales data, product attributes, and market factors. The primary goal of this project is to:

- Develop a model that learns optimal pricing strategies.
- Optimize model parameters through an automated pricing strategy.
- Implement the model in production for real-time price adjustments.

The model is based on reinforcement learning and deep learning techniques, where pricing decisions are treated as actions to maximize a reward function, which in our case is the revenue.

## Experimental Setup

### Data
We used the following datasets to train and evaluate the model:
- **Sales data**: Historical data for product prices, quantities sold, and market conditions.
- **External factors**: Market conditions, competitor pricing, and promotional events.

### Software Dependencies
- Python >= 3.8
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- SQL Database for data storage

To set up the environment, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-pricing.git
cd dynamic-pricing

# Create a virtual environment with Python >= 3.8
conda create -n dynamic_pricing python=3.8
conda activate dynamic_pricing

# Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
